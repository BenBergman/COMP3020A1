Informal Interview Script

The system we are trying to design is a movie organizer that allows the user to search for information about a movie using many parameters as well as adding personal information such as a personal rating, marking films as "to view", and listing recommendations of friends.

If you were to use such a system, what features do you think would be most valuable?

When you are looking for a movie to watch, what are your valued sources for recommendations?

What would make it easier to integrate this system into your present movie watching "work-flow"?

What features would you like to see in a mobile phone application? A browser plugin?

What would motivate you to use this kind of system? What would motivate your friends to use this kind of system?

When using similar software that helps organize media in your life, what have been some features that you have found frustrating?
