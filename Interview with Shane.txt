The system we are trying to design is a movie organizer that allows the user to search for information about a movie 
using many parameters as well as adding personal information such as a personal rating, marking films as "to view", 
and listing recommendations of friends.

Shane: Having it be easy to use an intuitive would be the bigest motivator for me and my friends, followed closely by the amount to content avaliable.

Katherine:
What would make it easier to integrate this system into your life-style?

Shane: Having it avaliable on multiple platforms, such as my computer and my phone, would make it easier to integrate.

Katherine:
What features would you like to see in a mobile phone application? A browser plugin?

Shane: A mobile phone app doesn't need as much detail, but it should include my personal reccomendations to help me decide which move to see on the go.

When you are looking for a movie to watch, what are your valued sources for recommendations?

Shane: I like to use review sites such as rottentomatoes.com that compile multiple reviews together. Friends and Family recommendations are also very important.
