Effectiveness:
  - Does the system allow users to search for films based on attributes (e.g., actors, director, movie type, year for movie, etc)?

  - Criteria: 
    - The system provides feedback to the user's commands.

Efficiency:
  - Does the system allow the user to do their modifications to the database quickly?

  - Criteria: 
    - Takes less than 2 minutes to add/change movie info.

Learnability:
  - Can the user quickly and easily learn how to search for and modify movie entries?
  - Criteria: 
    - User does not close program within 5 minutes due to frustration.
    - Interface intuitive enough to render outside help (eg manuals, instructor) unnecessary.

Memorability:
  - Can user easily remember primary tasks after not using the system for an extended period of time?
  - Criteria: 
    - User can modify movie info in less than 5 minutes after not using system for extended period (eg one month).

c) User Experience Goals

Enjoyable
Motivating

"Aesthetically pleasing" was considered higher priority for the expected user base (people very interested in film and art) however it was not chosen due to the constraints of quickly making an interface in VisualStudio.
